        title: 'The First Petition',
        petitionText: 'Hallowed be your name',
        meditation: `Yes, Lord God, dear Father, hallowed be your name, both in us and throughout the whole world. Destroy and root out the abominations, idolatry, and heresy of all false teachers and factious spirits who falsely bear your name and thus shamefully abuse it and horribly blaspheme it. They deeply disgrace you and mislead your people.

Dear Lord God, convert and restrain them. Convert those who are still to be converted that they with us and we with them may hallow and praise your name, both with true and pure doctrine and with a good and holy life. Restrain those who are unwilling to be converted so that they are forced to cease from misusing, defiling, and dishonoring your holy name and from misleading the poor people.

Grant that your name may be hallowed and praised through a pure and true doctrine and through a godly Christian life. Help us too, dear Lord, who are called by your name, that we may keep this name holy and honorable in all our words and works. Amen.`

        petitionText: 'Your kingdom come',
        meditation: `O dear Lord, God and Father, you see how worldly wisdom and reason not only profane your name and ascribe the honor due to you to lies and to the devil, but how they also take the power, might, wealth, and glory which you have given them on earth, and use them in their service and to their own advantage against your kingdom.

They think they are capable of ruling and preserving their domain by their own power and wisdom. Convert and restrain them, dear Lord. Convert those who have yet to become children and members of your kingdom so that they may reign with you in your kingdom. Restrain those who will not be converted so they will not interfere with the progress of your kingdom.

Help us and all your children to remain steadfast in your word and to glorify and magnify your kingdom. By your grace alone, make the kingdom of the devil powerless, so that he may have no right or power over us and so that we might be freed from his tyranny. Amen.`

        id: 3,
        type: 'petition',
        petitionText: 'Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven',
        meditation: `O dear Lord, God and Father, you know that the world cannot and will not endure your will. Therefore many attack your kingdom with murder, lies, violence, and injustice, thinking they are doing you a service. Some, thinking they are wise and good, persecute and blaspheme your word and will, and they think they know better than you.

Dear Father, convert them and defend us. Convert those who are not yet your servants that they may perceive and accept your good will and not consider their own will good and better than yours. Strengthen and preserve us, your children, so that we may keep and do your will in life and in death, in good and evil, and break, sacrifice, and surrender our own will to yours.

Grant that we may cheerfully bear every evil, cross, and adversity we encounter in this life, knowing that such is your divine, gracious, and good will. Help us to recognize that without your will, not a hair can fall from our head, and that you allow nothing to happen except what serves our salvation. Amen.`

        id: 4,
        type: 'petition',
        petitionText: 'Give us this day our daily bread',
        meditation: `O dear Lord, God and Father, grant us your blessing in this temporal and physical life. Graciously grant us blessed peace. Give our rulers and all in authority wisdom and strength to govern well and to vanquish the Turks and all enemies. Give them a good understanding so they may conduct themselves wisely toward all.

Especially give them a right understanding and sincere purpose in all matters that affect your word and the Christian church so that by their protection and support your kingdom may grow and flourish, your will be done, and your name be hallowed.

Grant favorable weather and good harvest, a good and productive year. Help me and my family, and give to all what they need in body and soul. Preserve us from fire, water, plague, and every kind of disaster. Keep my house, home, wife, and child safe from harm. Amen.`

        id: 5,
        type: 'petition',
        petitionText: 'Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors',
        meditation: `O dear Lord, God and Father, enter not into judgment against us because no one living is righteous before you. Do not count it against us as a sin that we are so ungrateful for your ineffable goodness, spiritual and physical, or that we daily sin against you more than we know or are aware.

Do not look upon how good or how wicked we have been but only upon the infinite compassion which you have bestowed upon us in Christ, your dear Son. Grant forgiveness also to those who have harmed or wronged us, as we forgive them from our hearts. They are pitiable people. They make their condition worse, and they do us no harm; rather, they harm themselves most terribly.

We would much rather that they be saved with us than that they should be lost. But if they will not be converted or cease their wickedness, we ask that you would turn their plans and all their efforts to naught and destroy them so that they cannot carry out their wicked plans to dishonor your name, to hinder your kingdom, and to suppress or obstruct your will. Amen.`

        id: 6,
        type: 'petition',
        petitionText: 'And lead us not into temptation',
        meditation: `O dear Lord, Father and God, keep us fit and alert, eager and diligent in your word and service, so that we do not become complacent, lazy, and slothful as though we had already achieved everything. In that way the fearful devil cannot fall upon us, surprise us, and deprive us of your precious word or stir up strife and factions among us and lead us into other sin and disgrace, both spiritually and physically.

Rather grant us wisdom and strength through your spirit that we may valiantly resist temptation and gain the victory. And if we should be hard pressed or overwhelmed, do not let us despair or succumb but grant us the certain assurance that you are near us in our distress and will wonderfully rescue us so that we may perceive your goodness and glorify you.

Make us constantly aware that we are still on the battlefield and under attack from the devil who is a fierce and mighty warrior. Let us never become so presumptuous that we think we have already conquered and need not struggle, watch, and pray any longer. Amen.`

    {
        id: 7,
        type: 'petition',
        petitionText: 'But deliver us from evil',
        meditation: `O dear Lord, God and Father, this wretched life is so full of misery and calamity, of danger and uncertainty, so full of malice and faithlessness, as Saint Paul says, that we could only wish we might die this very hour and come to be with you in your kingdom. But your divine will be done.

Grant us a strong faith to look with confidence beyond this vale of sorrows and to comfort ourselves with the assurance of your grace and of eternal life so that we may await your good will with patience. Do not allow us to be torn from you because of impatience or unbelief.

When at last our hour has come, grant us a blessed departure from this vale of sorrows so that in the power of your word and the comfort of your holy sacraments we may pass in true faith from death to eternal life. And on that great day of resurrection, raise us from the dead to eternal joy and glory. Amen.`

    content: `Finally, mark this, that you must always speak the Amen firmly. Never doubt that God in his mercy will surely hear you and say "yes" to your prayers. Never think that you are kneeling or standing alone, rather think that the whole of Christendom, all devout Christians, are standing there beside you and you are standing among them in a common, united petition which God cannot disdain.

Do not leave your prayer without having said or thought, "Very well, God has heard my prayer; this I know as a certainty and a truth." That is what Amen means. You should know that God does not jest with us when he commands us to pray and when he promises to hear us. Amen. Amen.`
