        title: 'The First Article: Creation',
        creedText: 'I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth',
        garland: {
            instruction: `I believe that God has created me and all that exists. That he has given me and still preserves my body and soul with all my limbs and senses, my reason and all my faculties. And also clothing and shoes, food and drink, house and home, wife and child, fields and cattle, and all my goods.

He provides me richly and daily with all the necessities of life, protects me from all danger, and guards and keeps me from all evil. And he does all this purely out of his fatherly and divine goodness and mercy, without any merit or worthiness in me. For all of this I am bound to thank, praise, serve, and obey him. This is most certainly true.`,
            thanksgiving: `I thank you, heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ your dear Son, that you have created me and given me life. You have made my body with all its members, my eyes and ears, my hands and feet, and all my senses. You have given me reason and understanding. You have provided me with food and drink, clothing and shelter, and all the good things of this life.

I thank you for preserving me each day and protecting me from harm. You watch over me when I sleep and when I wake. You have kept me safe from countless dangers that I have never even known about. You are my good and gracious Father, and all that I am and all that I have comes from your generous hand.`,
            confession: `I confess that I have been terribly ungrateful for all your gifts. I have taken your blessings for granted and have not thanked you as I should. I have worried and been anxious as though you were not my loving Father who cares for me. I have not used the body and abilities you gave me to serve you and others.

I have misused your creation and have not been a faithful steward of what you have entrusted to me. I have grumbled and complained when I should have been thankful. I have trusted in my own strength and wisdom instead of relying on you. Forgive me for my ingratitude and lack of faith.`,
            prayer: `Heavenly Father, help me to trust in your fatherly care and goodness. Teach me to see your hand in all things and to thank you daily for your countless blessings. Give me faith to trust that you will provide all I need for body and soul. Make me a faithful steward of all the gifts you have given me.

I pray for those who do not know you as their Creator and Father. Open their eyes to see your goodness in creation. Help all who are in need—the hungry, the homeless, the sick, and the suffering. Grant that we may use the resources you have given us to help others and to care for your creation. Keep me mindful that all things come from you and that I owe you my thanks, praise, and obedience. Amen.`

        title: 'The Second Article: Redemption',
        creedText: 'And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty. From thence he will come to judge the living and the dead',
        garland: {
            instruction: `I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord. He has redeemed me, a lost and condemned creature, purchased and won me from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil.

He did this not with gold or silver, but with his holy, precious blood and with his innocent suffering and death. He did all this so that I may be his own, live under him in his kingdom, and serve him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness, just as he is risen from the dead, lives and reigns to all eternity. This is most certainly true.`,
            thanksgiving: `I thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, that you came from heaven to earth to save me. Though you were rich, you became poor for my sake. Though you were Lord of all, you became a servant. You took on human flesh and were born of the Virgin Mary. You lived a perfect life in my place, keeping God's law perfectly.

You suffered and died on the cross to pay for my sins. You bore God's wrath that I deserved. You descended into hell and conquered death and the devil. You rose from the dead on the third day, proving that your sacrifice was accepted. You ascended into heaven where you reign in glory and intercede for me. I thank you that through faith in you, I am forgiven, redeemed, and made a child of God.`,
            confession: `I confess that I have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed. I am by nature sinful and unclean. I deserve God's wrath and eternal punishment. I have broken God's commandments daily and have fallen short of his glory. I cannot save myself or make myself worthy of God's love.

I confess that I have not always valued your sacrifice as I should. I have taken your grace for granted. I have not lived as one who has been bought with such a price. I have not shared the good news of your salvation with others as boldly as I ought. Forgive me for my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteousness.`,
            prayer: `Lord Jesus, thank you for your great love in dying for me. Help me to never forget the cost of my salvation. Strengthen my faith in you as my only Savior. Let me never trust in my own works or worthiness but only in your perfect sacrifice for me.

Grant that I may live as one who has been redeemed—in righteousness, innocence, and blessedness. Help me to die to sin and live for you. When you come again to judge the living and the dead, grant that I may be found in you, clothed in your righteousness. I pray for those who do not yet know you as Savior. Draw them to yourself. Give me opportunities and courage to share the gospel with them. Come quickly, Lord Jesus. Amen.`

        title: 'The Third Article: Sanctification',
        creedText: 'I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen',
        garland: {
            instruction: `I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ my Lord or come to him. But the Holy Spirit has called me by the gospel, enlightened me with his gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith. In the same way he calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith.

In this Christian church he daily and richly forgives all my sins and the sins of all believers. On the last day he will raise me and all the dead and give eternal life to me and all believers in Christ. This is most certainly true.`,
            thanksgiving: `I thank you, Holy Spirit, for calling me to faith through the gospel. You opened my blind eyes to see my sin and my need for a Savior. You created faith in my heart to believe in Jesus Christ. You continue to work in me, sanctifying me and making me more like Christ. You have given me spiritual gifts to serve the church.

I thank you for the Christian church, the communion of saints, where believers gather to hear God's word and receive the sacraments. I praise you for the daily forgiveness of sins through Christ. I thank you for the promise of resurrection and eternal life. All of this is your work, not mine, and I give you all the glory.`,
            confession: `I confess that I have often resisted your work in my life. I have grieved you by my sins and have quenched your promptings. I have not used the spiritual gifts you gave me to serve others as I should. I have been lukewarm in my faith and have not grown in holiness as you desire.

I have not valued the church as I ought and have neglected worship and fellowship with other believers. I have not been quick to forgive others as you have forgiven me. I have doubted your promises and have lived more by sight than by faith. Forgive me and renew in me a right spirit.`,
            prayer: `Holy Spirit, continue your good work in me. Strengthen my faith daily through your word and sacraments. Make me holy as you are holy. Help me to put to death the deeds of the flesh and to walk in the Spirit. Give me love for the church and for my brothers and sisters in Christ.

Unite all believers in the truth of your word. Protect the church from false teaching and division. Give pastors and teachers wisdom to rightly proclaim your truth. Help me to be quick to forgive as I have been forgiven. Comfort me with the assurance of eternal life.

On the last day, raise me from the dead with a glorified body like Christ's. Bring me and all believers into the everlasting joy of heaven where we will praise Father, Son, and Holy Spirit forever. Come, Holy Spirit, and fill me afresh each day. Amen.`
