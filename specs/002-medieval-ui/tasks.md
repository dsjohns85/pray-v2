# Implementation Tasks: Medieval Prayer Book UI Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `002-medieval-ui`  
**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md)

---

## Overview

This document breaks down the medieval UI enhancement into executable tasks organized by user story. Each user story represents an independently testable increment that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.

**Total User Stories**: 5 (2 P1, 2 P2, 1 P3)  
**Implementation Strategy**: MVP-first (User Story 1+2), then incremental enhancements

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### User Story Dependencies

```
Setup Phase (Phase 1)
    ↓
Foundational Phase (Phase 2)
    ↓
├─→ [US1] Illuminated Page Transitions (P1) ←── MVP Start
├─→ [US2] Illuminated Initial Capitals (P1) ←── MVP Complete
    ↓
├─→ [US3] Aged Parchment Theme (P2)
├─→ [US4] Medieval Typography (P2)
    ↓
└─→ [US5] Decorative Borders (P3)
    ↓
Polish & Cross-Cutting (Final Phase)
```

**Key**: Stories are largely independent. US1 and US2 can be developed in parallel after foundational work. US3-US5 can also be parallelized.

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**After Setup + Foundational**:
- US1 (animations.js) + US2 (illuminated.js) can be built simultaneously (different files)
- US3 (medieval.css) + US4 (fonts + typography CSS) can be built simultaneously
- US5 (decorations) depends only on foundational CSS, can start anytime after Phase 2

**Recommended MVP**: Complete US1 + US2 first for maximum user impact with minimal scope.

## Notes

- **No test tasks by default**: Tests are manual via checklists. Automated testing not specified in requirements.
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core prayer functionality works even if medieval enhancements fail to load.
- **Accessibility is non-negotiable**: Every task must maintain or improve accessibility.
- **Performance budgets**: All tasks must respect 800-1200ms transition, <2s asset load, 60fps animation targets.
- **Constitution compliance**: Feature follows Simplicity First, Progressive Enhancement, Accessibility Always principles.

---

**Ready for Implementation**: Tasks are specific, independently executable, and organized by user story for incremental delivery.
