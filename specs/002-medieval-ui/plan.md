# Implementation Plan: Medieval Prayer Book UI Enhancement

**Branch**: `002-medieval-ui` | **Date**: October 26, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-medieval-ui/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Transform the Luther Prayer Guide web application with a medieval aesthetic inspired by 15th-century prayer books. Implementation focuses on five key visual enhancements: smooth page-turning transitions using Web Animations API (WAAPI), illuminated initial capitals for text hierarchy, aged parchment backgrounds, medieval-inspired typography, and decorative borders. All animations will use deliberately slower timing (800-1200ms) to encourage contemplative pacing. Technical approach prioritizes accessibility (reduced motion preferences, WCAG AA contrast) and progressive enhancement (core functionality remains available during asset loading).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES6+ (modern browser support)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Web Animations API (WAAPI), CSS Custom Properties, modern CSS (Grid/Flexbox)  
**Storage**: N/A (frontend-only enhancement to existing static site)  
**Testing**: Browser visual regression testing, accessibility testing (reduced motion, high contrast), performance testing (animation timing)  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 84+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13.1+, Edge 84+) with WAAPI support  
**Project Type**: Web frontend (static site enhancement)  
**Performance Goals**: Page transitions 800-1200ms, decorative assets load <2s on 3G, maintain 60fps during animations  
**Constraints**: WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 body, 3:1 headings), honor prefers-reduced-motion, functional on 320px width  
**Scale/Scope**: 5 prayer sections, ~10 screens total, existing docs/ folder structure

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial Status**: ✅ PASSED (Constitution file is a template - no specific gates defined yet)

**Post-Phase 1 Re-check**: ✅ PASSED

**Notes**: 
- The project's `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is currently a template without specific rules
- This feature follows web best practices: progressive enhancement, accessibility-first, performance budgets
- No architectural violations identified
- Design maintains simplicity: 5 focused JavaScript modules, no frameworks/libraries beyond native browser APIs
- Asset loading strategy uses progressive enhancement (core functionality available immediately)
- All complexity is justified by user experience requirements (medieval aesthetics) without compromising accessibility or performance

```

**Structure Decision**: This is a frontend-only enhancement to an existing static web application. All changes occur within the `docs/` folder (which is the deployed site). We're adding new CSS and JavaScript modules to layer medieval aesthetics over the existing prayer guide functionality. The existing `app.js` will be updated to use the new `animations.js` module for page transitions, while `illuminated.js` will process text content to add decorative capitals. Assets are organized by type (fonts, textures, decorations) for clear separation of concerns.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

N/A - No constitutional violations. This is a straightforward frontend enhancement using standard web APIs.
