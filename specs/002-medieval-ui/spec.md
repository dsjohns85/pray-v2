# Feature Specification: Medieval Prayer Book UI Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `002-medieval-ui`  
**Created**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Design and implement a significant UI enhancement inspired by the aesthetic and motion of 15th century prayer books"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Illuminated Page Transitions (Priority: P1)

When users navigate between prayer sections, they experience smooth, reverent page-turning animations reminiscent of carefully turning delicate manuscript pages. The transitions include subtle aging effects and natural motion that encourages contemplative pacing rather than rushed clicking.

**Why this priority**: This is the core visual experience that transforms the app from a digital utility into a meditative prayer companion. It sets the tone for the entire experience and is immediately visible to all users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating between any two sections (e.g., Petitions to Commandments) and observing the page transition animation, delivering a distinct visual experience that differentiates the app.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is viewing the Petitions section, **When** they click "Continue to Commandments", **Then** the current page gently fades and slides as if being turned, revealing the next section with a subtle pause
2. **Given** user is navigating quickly through sections, **When** they click navigation buttons repeatedly, **Then** transitions queue gracefully without jarring interruptions or visual glitches
3. **Given** user is on a mobile device, **When** they swipe between sections, **Then** the page-turn animation follows their finger motion naturally

---

### User Story 2 - Illuminated Initial Capitals (Priority: P1)

The first letter of each major section (petition titles, commandment text, creed phrases) displays as an ornate, colored initial capital letter inspired by medieval manuscript illumination. These decorative elements provide visual hierarchy and beauty without distracting from the prayer content.

**Why this priority**: Illuminated capitals are the most recognizable visual feature of medieval manuscripts and provide immediate aesthetic connection to the source inspiration while enhancing readability through visual hierarchy.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing any prayer section and verifying the first letter displays with decorative styling, delivering instant visual enhancement even if other features aren't implemented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens any petition, **When** the text displays, **Then** the first letter appears larger with ornate styling in a contrasting color
2. **Given** user views multiple sections, **When** comparing initial capitals, **Then** each uses appropriate decorative style variations while maintaining visual consistency
3. **Given** user is on a small screen, **When** viewing illuminated capitals, **Then** they scale proportionally without overlapping surrounding text

---

### User Story 3 - Aged Parchment Visual Theme (Priority: P2)

The interface presents content on a background that evokes aged vellum or parchment, with subtle texture, warm tones, and gentle variations in color that suggest the passage of time. This creates an immersive historical atmosphere without compromising text readability.

**Why this priority**: The parchment aesthetic creates environmental consistency and immersion, but the app remains functional even with standard backgrounds. This enhances the experience but isn't critical to core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing any screen and observing background appearance, delivering atmospheric enhancement independently of other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user views any section, **When** the page loads, **Then** the background displays with subtle parchment texture and warm, aged coloring
2. **Given** user reads text on the parchment background, **When** viewing for extended periods, **Then** text remains clearly legible without eye strain
3. **Given** varying lighting conditions, **When** user views the interface, **Then** parchment effect adjusts for readability (respects system dark mode preferences)

---

### User Story 4 - Medieval Typography Enhancement (Priority: P2)

Text displays using typefaces that evoke medieval manuscript hands (such as uncial or blackletter-inspired fonts) for headings, while maintaining highly readable serif fonts for body text. Font sizing and spacing follow medieval manuscript proportions for visual authenticity.

**Why this priority**: Typography enhances the medieval aesthetic but requires careful balance with readability. It's important for atmosphere but not essential for the prayer functionality itself.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing any text content and observing font choices and sizing, delivering stylistic enhancement that works independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user views section headings, **When** text renders, **Then** headings use medieval-inspired typeface that remains clearly readable
2. **Given** user reads prayer content, **When** viewing body text, **Then** font choice prioritizes readability while maintaining period-appropriate serif styling
3. **Given** user adjusts device text size settings, **When** content reflows, **Then** proportions and hierarchy remain appropriate

---

### User Story 5 - Marginalia and Decorative Borders (Priority: P3)

Select pages feature decorative borders inspired by medieval manuscript ornamentation, particularly around major section transitions (welcome screen, amen screen, completion). Small decorative elements or "marginalia" appear subtly in corners or margins without cluttering the interface.

**Why this priority**: Decorative borders add polish and delight but are the least essential to core functionality. They're beautiful additions that enhance immersion for engaged users but aren't noticed if absent.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing welcome or completion screens and observing border decorations, delivering enhanced visual polish as a standalone enhancement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user reaches the welcome screen, **When** page loads, **Then** decorative border elements frame the content appropriately
2. **Given** user is praying through petitions, **When** viewing content sections, **Then** marginalia appears subtly without competing with prayer text
3. **Given** user completes a prayer session, **When** viewing the amen screen, **Then** decorative elements provide a sense of completion and beauty

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user has reduced motion preferences enabled? (System should honor accessibility settings and use minimal or no animation)
- How does the medieval aesthetic appear on very small screens (320px width)? (Decorative elements should scale down gracefully or hide if necessary)
- What happens when user has high contrast mode enabled? (Parchment effects should reduce/disable to maintain accessibility)
- How does the interface handle very long prayer text that exceeds typical manuscript page length? (Scrolling should maintain aesthetic consistency)
- What happens on slow network connections when decorative assets load? (Core content should remain functional; decorations load progressively)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
