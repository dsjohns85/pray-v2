# Implementation Testing Checklist: Medieval Prayer Book UI Enhancement

**Feature**: 002-medieval-ui  
**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Purpose**: Manual testing checklist for verifying medieval UI enhancement implementation

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Project Initialization

- [ ] Directory structure created (docs/assets/{fonts, textures, decorations})
- [ ] Empty module files created (medieval.css, animations.js, illuminated.js, decorations.js)
- [ ] medieval.css linked in index.html after styles.css
- [ ] app.js confirmed using type="module"

---

## Phase 2: Foundational CSS Theme System

- [ ] CSS custom properties defined and accessible in DevTools
- [ ] Parchment colors render correctly
- [ ] Animation timing variables are defined
- [ ] Accessibility media queries respond to system preferences:
  - [ ] prefers-reduced-motion reduces animation durations
  - [ ] prefers-contrast removes decorative textures
  - [ ] prefers-color-scheme switches dark mode colors
- [ ] .visually-hidden utility class hides content visually but not from screen readers

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Illuminated Page Transitions

### Functional Testing

- [ ] Page transition occurs when navigating between sections
- [ ] Transition timing is 800-1200ms (use Chrome DevTools Performance to measure)
- [ ] Transition has smooth page-turn visual effect
- [ ] Rapid navigation queues transitions (no visual glitches)
- [ ] Reduced motion preference disables animations (instant transitions)

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Keyboard focus maintained after transitions
- [ ] Screen reader announces new page content after transition
- [ ] Page transitions don't cause motion sickness at normal speed

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Transitions maintain 60fps (check Performance tab)
- [ ] Memory doesn't leak during repeated transitions
- [ ] Transitions work on mobile viewport (320px width)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Illuminated Initial Capitals

### Functional Testing

- [ ] Illuminated capitals appear on all major sections (Petitions, Commandments, Creed)
- [ ] Capitals use different colors from the medieval palette
- [ ] Capitals are larger and styled appropriately
- [ ] Only first letter of each section is illuminated (not every paragraph)

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Screen readers announce full text correctly (not just capital letter)
- [ ] Capitals have aria-hidden="true" attribute
- [ ] Text remains readable with capitals in place

### Responsive Testing

- [ ] Capitals scale appropriately on small screens (320px)
- [ ] Capitals don't overlap with body text
- [ ] Capitals render correctly on high-DPI displays

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Aged Parchment Theme

### Functional Testing

- [ ] Parchment background visible on all screens
- [ ] Parchment texture subtle but present
- [ ] Warm color tone creates medieval aesthetic

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Text maintains WCAG AA contrast ratios:
  - [ ] Body text: 4.5:1 minimum
  - [ ] Heading text: 3:1 minimum
- [ ] Dark mode parchment theme works correctly
- [ ] High contrast mode removes texture, maintains readability

### Browser Testing

- [ ] Parchment renders consistently in Chrome
- [ ] Parchment renders consistently in Firefox
- [ ] Parchment renders consistently in Safari
- [ ] SVG noise filter works across browsers

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Medieval Typography

### Functional Testing

- [ ] Medieval font loads for headings (UnifrakturMaguntia)
- [ ] Serif font loads for body text (Crimson Pro)
- [ ] Typography creates clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] Font fallbacks work if Google Fonts unavailable

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Fonts scale with user text size preferences (browser zoom)
- [ ] Body text remains highly readable
- [ ] Line height provides adequate spacing

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Fonts load within 2s on 3G connection (use DevTools throttling)
- [ ] Font swap prevents invisible text (font-display: swap)

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Decorative Borders

### Functional Testing

- [ ] Decorations appear on welcome screen
- [ ] Decorations appear on amen screen
- [ ] Decorations appear on completion screen
- [ ] Decorations are ornamental and period-appropriate

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Decorations have aria-hidden="true"
- [ ] Screen readers don't announce decorative elements
- [ ] Decorations don't interfere with text readability

### Responsive Testing

- [ ] Decorations hide on mobile viewports (<600px)
- [ ] Decorations scale appropriately on tablet viewports
- [ ] Decorations don't cause layout shifts

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Decoration assets load within 2s performance budget
- [ ] SVG files are optimized (small file sizes)

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Integration Testing

- [ ] All medieval features work together harmoniously
- [ ] No visual conflicts between features
- [ ] Progressive enhancement works (core functionality available immediately)

### Performance Audit

- [ ] Page load time acceptable (<3s on 3G)
- [ ] Animation frame rate consistently 60fps
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
- [ ] Asset loading doesn't block prayer functionality

### Accessibility Audit

- [ ] axe DevTools reports no violations
- [ ] Complete user journey works with keyboard only
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed (NVDA/JAWS)
- [ ] Color contrast verified with contrast analyzer

### Cross-Browser Testing

- [ ] Chrome: All features work
- [ ] Firefox: All features work
- [ ] Safari: All features work
- [ ] Edge: All features work
- [ ] Mobile browsers: Core features work

## Final Acceptance

- [ ] All user stories from spec.md implemented
- [ ] All success criteria from spec.md met
- [ ] Manual testing checklist completed
- [ ] No critical bugs remaining
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for deployment
