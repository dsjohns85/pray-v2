# Implementation Plan: Luther Prayer Guide

**Branch**: `001-luther-prayer-guide` | **Date**: 2025-10-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-luther-prayer-guide/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a simple static web application that guides users through Martin Luther's prayer method using the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer. The app presents static content (petition text, personal application, confession, intercessory prayer) with user-paced navigation. Optional extensions include the Ten Commandments and Apostle's Creed. The technical approach is a minimal static site deployable to GitHub Pages, using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for maximum simplicity and zero dependencies.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+, native browser support)
**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks or build tools)
**Storage**: Browser localStorage for session state persistence (optional for MVP)
**Testing**: Manual testing for MVP (low-risk static content display)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions)
**Project Type**: Static web application (single-page or multi-page to be determined in research)
**Performance Goals**: Instant page loads (<100ms), smooth transitions, works offline after initial load
**Constraints**: Must work without internet after first visit, minimal file size (<500KB total), accessible via keyboard navigation
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user local experience, ~20-30 content screens (7 petitions + amen + 10 commandments + creed sections), GitHub Pages deployment

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Simplicity (YAGNI)

✅ **PASS** - Using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with zero dependencies
- No frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) - just native browser APIs
- No build tools (webpack, vite) - direct file serving
- No backend server - pure static content
- Minimal abstractions - direct DOM manipulation

**Justification**: This is the simplest possible approach for displaying static content with basic navigation. Any framework or build system would add unnecessary complexity for this use case.

### II. Flexibility

✅ **PASS** - Testing strategy appropriate for feature risk
- **Risk Level**: Low (static content display, no user data, no security concerns)
- **Testing Approach**: Manual testing for MVP is sufficient
- **Rationale**: Content correctness can be verified by inspection, navigation is simple state management, no APIs or data integrity concerns

### III. Clarity

✅ **PASS** - Clear architectural decisions documented
- Decision: Static site architecture documented in this plan
- Decision: Vanilla JavaScript documented with rationale (simplicity)
- Decision: GitHub Pages deployment documented with setup steps (to come in quickstart.md)
- Code will use clear naming and comments for prayer content structure

### Development Standards

✅ **PASS** - Feature has clear acceptance criteria in spec.md
✅ **PASS** - User stories are independently testable (P1, P2, P3)
✅ **PASS** - This plan.md serves as the design document

### Quality Expectations

✅ **PASS** - Minimal coupling (single-page app with no external dependencies)
✅ **PASS** - No dependencies to declare (vanilla JavaScript)
✅ **PASS** - No configuration needed (hardcoded content)
✅ **PASS** - No secrets involved

**Overall Status**: ✅ ALL GATES PASSED - Ready for Phase 0

**Structure Decision**: GitHub Pages static site architecture

The `/docs` directory is used because GitHub Pages can serve directly from this folder without additional configuration. This eliminates the need for a build process or gh-pages branch management.

**Rationale**:
- **Single HTML file**: All UI elements in one file for maximum simplicity (no routing, no bundling)
- **Content modules**: Separate JS files for content organization and maintainability
- **Single CSS file**: Simple styling, no preprocessors or CSS-in-JS
- **No build process**: Files are served directly as-is by GitHub Pages
- **No tests directory**: Manual testing sufficient for this low-risk feature per constitution

**Navigation Approach**: Single-page application (SPA) using JavaScript to show/hide content sections. This provides smooth transitions and maintains session state without page reloads.
