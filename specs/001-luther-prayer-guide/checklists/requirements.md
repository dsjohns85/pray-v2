# Specification Quality Checklist: Luther Prayer Guide

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**: ✅
- Spec focuses on user experience (prayer journey, pacing, content elements)
- No technology stack mentioned
- Written in accessible language about prayer practices
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable
- Success criteria include both quantitative (90% success rate, 5min-hours duration) and qualitative (user feedback) measures
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not system internals)
- Three user stories each have clear acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases section identifies 5 boundary conditions
- "Out of Scope" section clearly bounds the MVP
- "Assumptions" section documents 7 key assumptions about users and use cases

**Feature Readiness**: ✅
- Each user story maps to specific functional requirements
- User Story 1 (P1) covers the complete MVP prayer experience
- User Stories 2 & 3 provide incremental value additions
- Success criteria focus on user experience (confusion-free navigation, unhurried feeling, distraction-free)
- No technology leakage detected

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan`
- The spec assumes content will be sourced from Luther's original work - this is documented in Assumptions but may require content research during planning
- Edge cases identify important UX decisions (resume vs. restart, navigation flexibility) that should be addressed in the implementation plan
