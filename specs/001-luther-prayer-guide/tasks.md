# Tasks: Luther Prayer Guide

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-luther-prayer-guide/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included in this task list as the constitution specifies manual testing is sufficient for this low-risk static content feature.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Static site**: `docs/` directory served by GitHub Pages
- All files referenced with absolute paths from repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create docs/ directory for GitHub Pages serving
- [X] T002 [P] Create docs/content/ directory for prayer content modules
- [X] T003 [P] Create docs/assets/ directory for static assets (optional)
- [X] T004 Create README.md with project overview and setup instructions

**Checkpoint**: Project structure ready for content and code

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core HTML structure and JavaScript foundation that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Create docs/index.html with basic HTML5 structure, semantic markup, and container elements for content display
- [X] T006 Create docs/styles.css with base styling (typography, colors, layout, minimal distraction-free design)
- [X] T007 Create docs/app.js with ES6 module structure, state management foundation, and navigation framework
- [X] T008 Implement state management in docs/app.js (AppState object, currentSection, currentIndex, currentView tracking)
- [X] T009 Implement navigation functions in docs/app.js (next(), previous(), show/hide content logic based on state)
- [X] T010 Implement localStorage persistence in docs/app.js (saveState(), loadState(), graceful fallback if unavailable)
- [X] T011 Implement content rendering engine in docs/app.js (renderContent() function that displays petition/commandment/creed based on current state)
- [X] T012 Add keyboard navigation support in docs/app.js (Enter for next, Escape for end session)
- [X] T013 Style navigation controls in docs/styles.css (Next button, End Session button, unobtrusive placement)
- [X] T014 Test local development setup (verify ES6 modules load correctly with local web server)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Independent of US1 but logically follows it in prayer sequence
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Independent of US1/US2 but logically follows them in prayer sequence
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
  - Delivers: Complete MVP prayer experience (7 petitions + amen)
  - Can ship this alone as v1.0

- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Technically independent of US1
  - Requires: US1 for Continue button from amen screen
  - Delivers: Extended prayer into Ten Commandments
  - Logical dependency: US1 should be complete first for prayer flow

- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Technically independent of US1/US2
  - Requires: US2 for Continue button from commandments end
  - Delivers: Extended prayer into Apostle's Creed
  - Logical dependency: US1 and US2 should be complete first for prayer flow

### Within Each User Story

- **Content tasks (T015-T022, T033-T042, T053-T055)**: All marked [P] - can run in parallel, different content items
- **Create content file**: Must wait for content research tasks to complete
- **Populate content file**: Depends on content file creation
- **Import and implement logic**: Depends on content file being populated
- **Styling**: Can happen in parallel with logic implementation ([P] where applicable)
- **Story complete**: All tasks in that story phase must be done

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup phase**: All tasks T001-T004 are independent (though T002-T003 depend on T001 for directory)
- **Foundational phase**: T006 (CSS) and T007-T014 (JS) can run in parallel after T005 (HTML)
- **User Story 1 content**: T015-T022 all [P] - can research all 7 petitions + amen simultaneously
- **User Story 2 content**: T033-T042 all [P] - can research all 10 commandments simultaneously
- **User Story 3 content**: T053-T055 all [P] - can research all 3 creed articles simultaneously
- **Polish phase**: Most tasks (T065-T070) marked [P] - can run in parallel
- **Different user stories**: After Foundational phase, US1, US2, US3 could theoretically be worked on by different developers in parallel (though logical flow suggests sequential)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all content research for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Research and extract First Petition content..." (T015)
Task: "Research and extract Second Petition content..." (T016)
Task: "Research and extract Third Petition content..." (T017)
Task: "Research and extract Fourth Petition content..." (T018)
Task: "Research and extract Fifth Petition content..." (T019)
Task: "Research and extract Sixth Petition content..." (T020)
Task: "Research and extract Seventh Petition content..." (T021)
Task: "Research and extract Amen explanation content..." (T022)

# After content research complete, create and populate content file:
Task: "Create docs/content/petitions.js..." (T023)
Task: "Add all 7 petition objects..." (T024)
Task: "Add amen object..." (T025)

# Then implement logic and styling (some can run in parallel):
Task: "Import petitions content..." (T026)
Task: "Implement petition display logic..." (T027) - can run with T030 [P]
Task: "Style petition display..." (T030) - can run with T027 [P]
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently - full prayer flow through 7 petitions to "Amen"
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages - users can pray through Lord's Prayer with Luther's method
6. Optionally do partial Polish (T065-T074 for responsive and testing)

**This is a complete, shippable product at this point.**

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (MVP! 15 screens)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Extended: 65 screens total)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Complete: 80 screens total)
5. Polish phase ‚Üí Final refinements ‚Üí Deploy

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (7 petitions + amen)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (10 commandments) - starts content research
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (3 creed articles) - starts content research
3. Sequential integration: Merge US1 ‚Üí test ‚Üí merge US2 ‚Üí test ‚Üí merge US3 ‚Üí test
4. Team tackles Polish phase together

**Note**: Due to logical prayer flow (petitions ‚Üí commandments ‚Üí creed), sequential development is recommended even though technical dependencies are minimal.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies (can run in parallel)
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story delivers independently testable prayer experience
- Content research is most time-consuming aspect - parallelize across team
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Tests are NOT included per constitution (manual testing sufficient for low-risk static content)
- Total of 80 tasks for complete implementation
- MVP (User Story 1) requires 32 tasks (T001-T032)
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
