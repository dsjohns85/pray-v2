# Feature Specification: Luther Prayer Guide

**Feature Branch**: `001-luther-prayer-guide`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we are building a very simple app to walk through a prayer sequence as written in Martin Luther's booklet, 'a simple way to pray'. it walks through the lord's prayer as 7 petitions, and through each one, there is a personal application of the petition, a recognition of where we fall short, praying to convert those who continually violate the petition including ourselves (such as hallowing god's name), and for those who will not convert, to provide hedges of protection against or something similar. there might be a few other elements, and likely reading through it will be helpful. the saint should be encouraged to stay on any petition for as long as they feel led. if/when they get to 'amen' there should be a small bit about the meaning of amen, and what we are declaring when we say it. that is probably enough for MVP, and there is also a carry on if the saint wants into the 10 commandments and the apostle's creed."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Guided Prayer Through Seven Petitions (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

A person wants to pray through the Lord's Prayer using Martin Luther's method. They open the app and are guided through each of the seven petitions sequentially. For each petition, they see the petition text, personal application, confession of shortcomings, and intercessory elements. They can linger on any petition as long as they feel led before moving to the next one. When finished, they read about the meaning of "Amen" and close their prayer session.

**Why this priority**: This is the core prayer experience and delivers the full value of Luther's prayer method. Without this, there is no app.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by walking through all seven petitions from start to "Amen" and verifying each petition displays its full content and allows user-paced progression.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I open the app, **When** I start a prayer session, **Then** I see the first petition with its personal application, confession, and intercessory prayer elements
2. **Given** I am on any petition, **When** I decide to stay longer, **Then** the app waits indefinitely until I indicate readiness to continue
3. **Given** I am on any petition, **When** I choose to move forward, **Then** I see the next petition with all its elements
4. **Given** I have completed all seven petitions, **When** I reach the end, **Then** I see content explaining the meaning of "Amen" and what I am declaring
5. **Given** I have read the "Amen" content, **When** I close the prayer, **Then** the session ends gracefully

---

### User Story 2 - Extended Prayer into Ten Commandments (Priority: P2)

After completing the seven petitions and "Amen," a person wants to continue praying through the Ten Commandments using Luther's method. They indicate their desire to continue, and the app guides them through each commandment with similar reflection elements.

**Why this priority**: Extends the prayer experience for those who want deeper engagement, but the seven petitions alone form a complete prayer session.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing the seven petitions, choosing to continue, and verifying the Ten Commandments content displays with appropriate reflection prompts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have completed the "Amen" section, **When** I see the option to continue, **Then** I can choose to proceed to the Ten Commandments
2. **Given** I choose to continue to the Ten Commandments, **When** the transition occurs, **Then** I see the first commandment with reflection elements
3. **Given** I am praying through the commandments, **When** I move through each one, **Then** I experience similar pacing and depth as the petitions
4. **Given** I complete all Ten Commandments, **When** I finish, **Then** I see an option to continue to the Apostle's Creed or end the session

---

### User Story 3 - Extended Prayer into Apostle's Creed (Priority: P3)

After completing the Ten Commandments (or after the seven petitions, if commandments were skipped), a person wants to pray through the Apostle's Creed. They indicate their desire to continue, and the app guides them through meditation on the Creed.

**Why this priority**: Completes the full Luther prayer method but represents the deepest level of engagement. Many users will find sufficient value in P1 or P1+P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reaching the Apostle's Creed entry point and verifying the Creed content displays with appropriate meditation prompts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have completed the Ten Commandments, **When** I see the option to continue, **Then** I can choose to proceed to the Apostle's Creed
2. **Given** I choose to continue to the Apostle's Creed, **When** the transition occurs, **Then** I see the Creed with meditation elements
3. **Given** I am meditating on the Creed, **When** I complete it, **Then** the prayer session concludes with appropriate closing
4. **Given** I complete the entire sequence, **When** I close the app, **Then** my progress is complete

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user closes the app mid-petition? (Should they resume where they left off, or start fresh?)
- What happens if a user wants to skip ahead or go back to a previous petition?
- What happens if a user wants to repeat a petition or section?
- How does the app handle very long prayer sessions (hours)?
- What happens if a user wants to exit early before reaching "Amen"?

- **Creed Section**: Part of the Apostle's Creed, contains creed text and meditation guidance

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete the seven petitions prayer sequence from start to "Amen" without confusion about navigation
- **SC-002**: Users report feeling unhurried and able to stay on each petition as long as desired (measured through user feedback or testing observation)
- **SC-003**: 90% of test users successfully identify and access the next petition when ready to advance
- **SC-004**: Users who choose to continue to Ten Commandments successfully transition without errors or confusion
- **SC-005**: Users report that the app enhances rather than distracts from their prayer experience (qualitative feedback)
- **SC-006**: Prayer sessions can accommodate varying durations from 5 minutes to multiple hours without performance issues

## Assumptions

- Content will be sourced from Martin Luther's "A Simple Way to Pray" - either direct quotations or faithful adaptations to modern language
- Users are familiar with Christian prayer practices and the Lord's Prayer structure
- The app is intended for individual, private prayer (not group or liturgical use)
- Users will self-pace through content and do not need timers or suggested durations
- The primary use case is contemplative prayer, not educational study (though content is instructive)
- Users prefer minimal interaction (few taps/clicks) during prayer to maintain focus
- Session state persistence (resuming mid-session) is desirable but not critical for MVP (P1)

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- User accounts or authentication
- Social features (sharing prayers, prayer groups)
- Audio or spoken guidance
- Customization of petition content or order
- Prayer journaling or notes
- Multiple language support
- Accessibility features beyond basic screen reader compatibility
- Analytics or tracking of prayer habits
- Reminders or scheduled prayer notifications
